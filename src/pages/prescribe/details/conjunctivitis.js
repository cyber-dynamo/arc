Photophobia, facial vesicles, irregular pupils, corneal opacities, pain, headaches and nausea were all absent. There were no reports of head trauma. Hence, urgent referral is not required. So far, the patient has not attempted any medications but has tried over the counter eye drops in the previous episode with moderate success. It is reported that dust and pollen can worsen the symptoms and resting alleviates them. Patient is currently on NO MEDICATIONS. Kidney or liver issues are also unremarkable. Patient is not pregnant and reports to have NO ALLERGIES to any medications."}

Medical intervention is necessary to alleviate the symptoms as other non-pharmacological interventions have failed. The effectiveness of the prescription is supported by evidence as per RxTx, medsask and BC guidelines. The prescription is safe for the patient as the dosage is within the therapeutic range as per RxTx and the patient is not allergic to it. Adherence should not be an issue as the patient is young and aware. There are also family members in case a reminder is needed."}
