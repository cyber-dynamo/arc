This has happened before in the past occasionally prior to this episode and usually lasts for about a week to a month. Judging from the absence of cysts and the low number nodules, the severity is categorized as mild. So far, the patient has not attempted any medications but has tried over the counter benzoyl peroxide in the previous episode but with moderate success. It is reported that stress and lack of sleep can worsen the symptoms and resting alleviates them. Patient is over 12yo and onset is not over 30yo. Distribution is not widespread and symptoms are not moderate or severe. There are also no signs of depression. Hence, urgent referral is not required. Patient is currently on NO MEDICATIONS. Kidney or liver issues are also unremarkable. Patient is not pregnant and reports to have NO ALLERGIES to any medications."}

Patient was told not to pick or squeeze the lesions which promote scarring. Oil free water based cosmetics were recommended to reduce irritations. RETIN-A CREAM DAILY AT NIGHT is prescribed to help alleviate the symptoms. Medical intervention is necessary to alleviate the symptoms as other non-pharmacological interventions have failed. The effectiveness of the prescription is supported by evidence as per RxTx, medsask and BC guidelines. The prescription is safe for the patient as the dosage is within the therapeutic range as per RxTx and the patient is not allergic to it. Adherence should not be an issue as the patient is young and aware. There are also family members in case a reminder is needed."}
