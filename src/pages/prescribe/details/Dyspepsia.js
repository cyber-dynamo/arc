Medical intervention is necessary to alleviate the symptoms as other non-pharmacological interventions have failed. The effectiveness of the prescription is supported by evidence as per RxTx, medsask and BC guidelines. The prescription is safe for the patient as the dosage is within the therapeutic range as per RxTx and the patient is not allergic to it. Adherence should not be an issue as the patient is young and aware. There are also family members in case a reminder is needed."}
