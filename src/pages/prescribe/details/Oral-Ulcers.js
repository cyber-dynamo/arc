Patient is not immunocompromised, duration is less than 14 days, ulcer count is less than 5 and pain is not severe. Hence, urgent referral is not required.

Sodium lauryl sulfate containing oral products should also be avoided. Vitamin B complex with Zinc or Iron can also be used to reduce recurrence. Oracort 0.1% to be applied three times daily is prescribed to help alleviate the symptoms. Medical intervention is necessary to alleviate the symptoms as other non-pharmacological interventions have failed. The effectiveness of the prescription is supported by evidence as per RxTx, medsask and BC guidelines. The prescription is safe for the patient as the dosage is within the therapeutic range as per RxTx and the patient is not allergic to it. Adherence should not be an issue as the patient is young and aware. The medication is also on as needed basis."}
